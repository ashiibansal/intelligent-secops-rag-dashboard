# Week 3 Development Summary

This week introduced semantic retrieval to the incident response system.

## Key Enhancements
- Built vector embeddings for incident descriptions
- Integrated FAISS-based similarity search
- Added a retrieval layer to identify relevant incidents
- Separated vector creation, loading, and querying logic

This retrieval pipeline forms the foundation for
retrieval-augmented generation in the next phase.
