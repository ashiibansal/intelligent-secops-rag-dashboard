# Week 4 Development Summary

This week introduced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Improvements
- Integrated Gemini LLM
- Used retrieved incident as contextual grounding
- Generated structured explanations automatically
- Transitioned system from search tool to AI assistant

The system can now interpret incidents rather than only retrieve them.
